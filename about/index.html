                </header>
                <p>The Yesterweb is driven by its community - everyday users of the internet, regular people with diverse skills and interests who care about online spaces.</p>

                <p>We acknowledge that the internet is made up of human beings. Conversing online doesn't make this any different. Behind every username is a real person with their own perspective and experiences.

                    <p>We do not tolerate hate speech including sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, chauvinism, and national/religious discrimination. We can do better.</p>

                    <p>It's not just about nostalgia or retro aesthetics but these interests signify that there is a need for change. Our goal is to forge a new path forward, toward building and cultivating a better internet. </p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The Yesterweb began as an empty Discord server in <strong>February of 2021</strong> and was created by <a href="https://sadgrl.online" target="_blank">Sadness</a>. The server was intended to be a communication tool for the community at Neocities.org, a a place for likeminded folks to discuss building websites.</p>
                    <p>As we continued to grow, we attracted a diverse group of people with a range of knowledge, skills and hobbies who all care deeply about the internet. We have <a href="/manifesto/">seen it shift and become what it is today</a>. We're starting small, by researching and sharing, making art, creating digital spaces, and figuring out how to unlearn harmful social habits from social media. </p>
                    <p>We hope to inspire people to create their own spaces online.</p>
                    <p>The Yesterweb is run by volunteers who dedicate their time out of love and passion for the internet and other people &hearts;</p>
                    <p>We are always <a href="/zine/issue-03/01/">changing and growing</a>.</p>

                            <summary>What role does nostalgia play in the Yesterweb?</summary>
                            <p>It's fun to be nostalgic about old design choices and aesthetics. There’s a lot of comfort in nostalgia, but’s more of an 'icing' than a 'cake'. We aren't blind to the shortcomings of the early web, instead we see the potential that was lost. And sometimes we just want to dress up our websites!</p>

                            <p>Yes, we know, but we choose Discord over the alternatives because that's where the most people are.</p>

                            <summary>Have you considered bridging the Discord server with [Matrix/IRC/XMPP]?</summary>
                            <p>Yes, we have tried a bridge before and it didn't work out. We aren't looking at alternatives currently.</p>
